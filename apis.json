In 1999, it became one of the first to set up a free online directory enquiries service - ukphonebook.com.Building on the popularity of ukphonebook.com, Corporate ukphonebook.com was created as a dedicated business service in 2000. It now supplies customers including Merseyside Police and Yorkshire Building Society with access to telephone and address information as well as the UK Electoral Roll.Further developments came in 2002 in response to the deregulation of voice directory enquiries services with the switch from the old access code to a range of competing services under the code 118xxx. Simunix took part in the high-profile number allocation lottery and chose 118080, 118365 and 118090 (for international directory enquiries). 118-Express was created at this time to coincide with the changes occurring in the industry sector.Most recent projects have included the development of TPS Manage, a TPS/CTPS check facility, and T2A, a powerful API for finding, validating and verifying data.Simunix now supplies its range of directory products and services to most private and public sectors including, police, banking, legal, local authorities and many more.",
